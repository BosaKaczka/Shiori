## Games
### Guess the number
#### Description

This extension allows users to play a guessing game, where they have to guess a secret number within a certain range. The bot keeps track of the user's attempts and provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.

#### Usage

To start a new game, use the `/guess` command followed by your guess. For example, to guess the number 42, type `/guess 42`. The bot will respond with feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low.

To check the current state of the game, use the `/secret_number` command. The bot will respond with the current range of possible numbers and the user's recent attempts.



## Feedback
#### Bug report
To report a bug, use the following command:

```/bug <bug_description>```

Replace <bug_description> with a brief description of the bug you encountered.
#### Submit an idea
To submit an idea for the bot, use the following command:

```/idea <your_idea>```

Replace <your_idea> with your suggestion for what you would like to see added to the bot.
